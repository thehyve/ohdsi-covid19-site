In March 2020, the [OHDSI community](https://www.ohdsi.org) has hosted a [virtual COVID-19 study-a-thon](https://www.ohdsi.org/ohdsi-news-updates/covid19-studyathon/) to inform healthcare decision-making in response to the current global pandemic. More than 300 researchers from all over the world have contributed to designing and executing a series of observational studies across the international OHDSI network of data captured during clinical practice; **these sources include electronic health records and administrative claims**. These retrospective analyses examine the **safety of proposed drugs**, as well as **predict outcomes for patients** with viral symptoms or complications.

In order to disseminate these results in a [FAIR](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/fair-principles-explained/) way, [The Hyve](https://www.thehyve.nl), as part of work done for [EHDEN](https://ehden.eu), has set up this page to collect and present metadata of the study-a-thon assets. All real-world evidence generated in the study-a-thon has been placed in the public domain to support and inform current public health efforts. Here, we make these results findable and accessible, using standardized and interoperable metadata standards.

The latest news of the ongoing studies can be found on [the official updates page](https://www.ohdsi.org/covid-19-updates/).
