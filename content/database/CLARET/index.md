# Description of the database
description: "Electronic medical record data on approximately 1 million patients who received care beginning in 2006 at Tufts Medical Center (TMC). TMC is an academic medical center that includes Tuft Medical Center's main downtown Boston hospital for adult patients, the Floating Hospital for Children, and associated primary and specialty care clinics. CLARET contains TMC's EHR data fused with data on the same patients from TMC's CoC accredited tumor registry, its oncology EHR, and death data from the Massachusetts State Registry of Vital Statistics. EHR data streams ingested into CLARET include controlled vocabulary data on all domains except cost, and select free text sources and devices."
